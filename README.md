# Day_15_Coffee_Machine_Intermidiate_project_
I built a Virtual Coffee Machine in Python. It lets users order drinks like espresso, latte, or cappuccino, manages resources like water and coffee, processes coin payments, and provides change. The machine also reports remaining resources and earnings. A great way to practice control flow and functions in Python!
